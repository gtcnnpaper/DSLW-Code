This repository contains the PyTorch codes for the paper:

E. Isufi and G. Mazzola, Graph-Time Convolutional Neural Networks, IEEE Data Science and Learning Workshop (DSLW), Toronto, Ontario, Canada, June 2021.

Parts of this code are taken verbatim from the GNNs library available here. The following is a description of the functions contained in the different folders used to generate the results in the paper. A cured and more explained version will be uploaded in the future.
